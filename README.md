MnMs bags problem and Bayes Theorem

Problem by Allen B. Downey (Source: https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkPython/#): 

Blue M&Ms were added in 1995, changing the color mix from 30% brown, 20% yellow, and so on, to include 24% blue and adjust other colors after 1995. Given two bags of M&Ms from 1994 and 1996, if I get a yellow M&M, how likely is it that it's from the 1994 bag? 
If I pick a yellow M&M from one bag and a green one from another (but I don't know which comes from which bag), how can I figure out the chance the yellow one is from the 1994 bag?
If I receive an orange and a red M&M, what's the chance the orange one is from the 1994 bag?
And if I get a tan and a red M&M, how likely is it that the red one is from 1994?
